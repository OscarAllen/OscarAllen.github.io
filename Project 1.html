<h1><u>Project</u> 1</h1>
  
<h2>The first project of the semester</h2>  

<p>For my first project I delved into some Photoshop and Illustrator. 
  Using the skills I learned last year, I recreated an old illustrator work into something else. 
  Itâ€™s not exactly what I would have liked but it should suffice for now. 
  I do plan on adding and editing it in the future. 
  The Photoshop I did was an image of a musician I like that I edited to look better. 
  The results were quite nice.</p>
